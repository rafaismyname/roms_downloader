# ROMs Downloader
A tool to download files from an index page.

Coincidentally, it can be used for downloading ROM collections in cases where you **legally** own those ROMs.

I plan to add more utilities that I often need for my voluntary work at my church and dog shelter, like described below in the [Features/Future](#featuresfuture) section.

## Data

The data inside `assets/consoles.json` is **merely fictional** for **testing purposes**, it's a placeholder/template.
I **do not** own nor recommend those sources. As a matter of fact, the first step in setting up this app to run locally is to edit that file, removing all the nonsense data and bringing your own index URLs.

## Downloading builds

I'm currently not relying on releases **JUST BECAUSE**. Meanwhile you can access the latest builds in the [build workflow page](https://github.com/rafaismyname/roms_downloader/actions/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml).
*Note: You must be logged in to GitHub to access the workflow page and download the build.*

## Instructions

- Clone.
- Update `assets/consoles.json` by deleting the placeholder data and bringing your own indexes (or use a custom file in the final app).
- Build, run, be happy.
- Treat others as you would like to be treated.

## Features/Future
- [x] Async loading and display of multiple console indexes/catalogs
- [x] Parallel, independent downloads with background support and tasks queue
- [x] Search and filter titles (by country/language, type, extension, etc.)
